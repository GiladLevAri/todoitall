# Todo it all

I once read this post called [Every time you build a to-do list app, a puppy üêï dies](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d).
So I'd like to apologize to all puppies out there, but this is an example of a simple Todo app.

**I actually built four todo apps.**
One as a _Class_ component using _State_.
One as a _Class_ component using _Redux_.
One as a _Hook_ function component using _State_.
One as a _Hook_ function component using the _Context_ API and the _useReducer_ hook.

I wanted to see and show the differences in implementations and in testing each type of component.

##### Still need to be done:

1. Write tests to the Redux version
2. Write test to the reducer / actions
3. Write tests to the Context + Reducer version
4. Write test to the custom hook _"useStore"_.
